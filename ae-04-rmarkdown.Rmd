# R Markdown

## Headings

## Markdown text

This is text written in markdown markup language. Markdown is written in **plain text** and produces formatted text. It's an **open format**, a file format with no restrictions, monetary or otherwise that can be fully processed with at least one free/libre/open-source software tool. As opposed to the .docx file format, which is a **proprietary** file format that a company owns and controls.

## Code chunks

Code chunks are added either by using a keyboard shortcut (Windows: Ctrl + Alt + I; MacOS: Cmd + Option + I) or by clicking on the green plus button in the menu bar of this file. 

Code is run either by a click on the green play button in the top right corner of the code chunk or by using a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl / Cmd + Enter) to execute code line by line. The code is sent to the Console where it is executed and the result is printed.

**Terminology**

- Assignment Operator: `<-` (Keyboard shortcut: Alt/Option + -)
- Function: `sum()`, `sqrt()`
- Object: Stored in current R session and can be viewed in 'Environment' Tab

## Inline code

You can also write code inline by using the single backtick, followed by the letter r and the code. 

## Concept Map

I have included a concept map of R Markdown below [(Copyright (c) RStudio)](https://github.com/rstudio/concept-maps/blob/master/LICENSE.md) under licensed under [CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You will learn how to use this code to include images as part of the course. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/concept-maps/master/en/rmarkdown.svg")
```

# Exercises

2. Copy the line of code to your clipboard (Ctrl + C).

3. Paste the line of code in the Console and hit ther Return (Enter) key.

## Exercise 1 - Knit, Add, Commit, Push

1. **Knit:** Render this file to HTML (*Tip: Click the Knit Button at the top of this file*)
2. **Add** Open the Git pane and add all files to the staging area (*Tip: Tick off all checkboxes under column 'Staged'*)
3. **Commit:** Commit pending changes, add a meaningful commit message 
4. **Push:** Push changes to the remote repository (i.e. GitHub)

## Exercise 2 - Research Questions + Design

1. Add the research questions that you and/or your group have worked on below. Write a bullet point for each research question and sub-question.

**remove me and write your text here**

2. Write up the research design you are planning to use for your data collection.

**remove me and write your text here**

3. Submit your sample population:

- Bins: (1) Number; (2) Location, (3) Frequency of sampling
- Human population, for example random, over 60, family, cyclist, etc.
  
You can download a CSV with data on all bins from:

- https://www.ogd.stadt-zuerich.ch/geoportal_download/71dc10de-a5e2-11ec-94cb-005056b0ce82.zip (**valid until 22nd March**)
- https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/geodaten/download/Abfallgefaesse (**Stadt ZÃ¼rich Open Data, in German**) 

**remove me and write your text here**

4. Write up the variables that are needed, together with the respective questions and possible response values.

**remove me and write your text here**

5. Knit, Add, Commit + Push your changes back to GitHub


## Exercise 2: Each ~~group~~ person will

1. Add the research questions that you and/or your group have worked on.

2. Write up the research design you are planning to use for your data collection.

3. Submit their sample population:

  - Bins: (1) Number; (2) Location, (3) Frequency of sampling
  - Human population, for example random, over 60, family, cyclist, etc.

4. Write up the variables that are needed, together with the respective questions and possible response values.


## Exercise 3 - Hyperlinks and Equations (**Bonus**)

# Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are essential when working with any programming language and we recommend to use from the start instead of using the point + click buttons that are available in RStudio. 

- **Add new code chunk:** Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I
- **Execute code line by line within a code chunk:** Ctrl/Cmd + Enter
- **Execute an entire code chunk:** Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter
- **The Pipe (%>%):** Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M
- **Assignment operator (<-)**: Alt/Option + -
